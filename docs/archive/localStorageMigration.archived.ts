/**
 * Archived: localStorageMigration.ts
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file contained legacy localStorage key migration logic to rescue
 * data from older key names (tenders / projects / clients) and optionally
 * from an Electron store bridge.
 *
 * Status: Archived (no active imports as of archival date).
 * Rationale: Startup cost + complexity no longer justified after users
 * have upgraded through multiple versions and standardized keys are in place.
 *
 * If a future need arises to re-enable historical recovery, restore the
 * implementation from git history or this archive and gate behind an
 * explicit feature flag to avoid unconditional runtime overhead.
